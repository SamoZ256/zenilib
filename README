1. Introduction
===============

The Zenipex Library is a game development framework, created 
with the goal of allowing someone with some knowledge of C++ 
to create 3D games for both Windows and Linux platforms (and 
hopefully others) quickly.

SDL combined with SDL_mixer already did much of the work 
*not* related to 3D graphics.  The focuses on the project 
were to abstract away some basic differences between OpenGL 
and Direct3D 9 and to create an object-oriented framework for 
game development.  It was never the goal to abstract away all 
differences between OpenGL and Direct3D or to create a fully 
optimzed game development library with every features you 
could possibly want.

Truly it started as an exercise in learning both OpenGL and 
Direct3D, with the hope that it would become something 
useful to me if to nobody else.  Hopefully someone else in 
Wolverine Soft will use the thing too ;)

This software is known to operate on:
 
- Windows: XP
- Linux: {Ku,U,Xu}buntu

It should be possible to build it on any platform supporting:

The Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) [http://www.libsdl.org/]

Direct3D 9 [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/]
     and/or

        - Required for graphics

OpenAL [http://www.openal.org/]
        - Required for sound

SDL_image [http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/]
        - Required for texture loading for OpenGL

SDL_gfx [http://www.ferzkopp.net/Software/SDL_gfx-2.0/]
        - Possibly required for texture resizing for OpenGL
        - Not required if images loaded are already in the 
          correcty format (both width and height powers of 2)

SDL_ttf [http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/]
        - Required for text rendering in OpenGL

lib3ds [http://lib3ds.sourceforge.net/]
        - Required for model loading and rendering
