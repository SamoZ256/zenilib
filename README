1. Introduction
===============

The Zenipex Library is a game development framework, created 
with the goal of allowing someone with some knowledge of C++ 
to create 3D games for both Windows and Linux platforms (and 
hopefully others) quickly.

SDL combined with SDL_mixer already did much of the work 
*not* related to 3D graphics.  The focuses on the project 
were to abstract away some basic differences between OpenGL 
and Direct3D 9 and to create an object-oriented framework for 
game development.  It was never the goal to abstract away all 
differences between OpenGL and Direct3D or to create a fully 
optimzed game development library with every features you 
could possibly want.

Truly it started as an exercise in learning both OpenGL and 
Direct3D, with the hope that it would become something 
useful to me if to nobody else.  Hopefully someone else in 
Wolverine Soft will use the thing too ;)
